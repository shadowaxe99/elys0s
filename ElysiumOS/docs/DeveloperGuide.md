# Elysium OS Developer Guide

Welcome to the Elysium OS development team. This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for developers working on Elysium OS, providing instructions, best practices, and reference information.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Git for version control
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration (optional)

Clone the repository using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/elysium-os/ElysiumOS.git
cd ElysiumOS
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains all source code for Elysium OS.
- `docs/`: Documentation for the project.
- `ui/`: Front-end web assets including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- `api/`: Back-end API setup with RESTful endpoints and services.
- `blockchain/`: Smart contracts and blockchain integration scripts.
- `world3d/`: 3D world assets, scenes, and scripts.
- `db/`: Database schema and migration files.
- `build/`: Compiled application artifacts.
- `deploy/`: Deployment configurations and scripts.

## Building the Project

To build the project, run:

```
./gradlew build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, execute:

```
java -jar build/ElysiumOS.jar
```

## Testing

Automated tests are located in `src/test/`. To run the tests, use:

```
./gradlew test
```

## Code Style and Conventions

We follow the standard Java coding conventions. Ensure your code is properly formatted and includes appropriate comments where necessary.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from all developers. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.

## Documentation

Update the `docs/` directory with any changes in functionality or new features. Documentation should be clear, concise, and written in Markdown.

## Automation Station

For developing custom automations, refer to `AutomationStationConfig.java` and `AutomationService.java`. Implement new tasks by extending `TaskScheduler.java`.

## The Arena

Game logic resides in `arena/`. Use `GameManager.java` to manage game states and `ScenarioGenerator.java` to create new scenarios.

## Blockchain Integration

Blockchain functionality is handled in `blockchain/`. `BlockchainService.java` manages the connection to the Arbitrum network, and `SmartContractManager.java` handles smart contract interactions.

## 3D World Rendering

For 3D world development, see `world3d/WorldRenderer.java` and `world3d/SceneBuilder.java`. Add new assets to `world3d/assets/`.

## Security

Ensure all code complies with security best practices. Sensitive data should be encrypted, and user data should be handled in accordance with privacy laws.

## Deployment

For deployment, use the provided `Dockerfile` and `deploy.sh` script. For Kubernetes deployments, modify `kubernetes/deployment.yaml` as needed.

## Feedback and Support

For any questions or issues, please open an issue on the GitHub repository or contact the project maintainers.

Thank you for contributing to Elysium OS, where we build the future of digital and physical integration.
